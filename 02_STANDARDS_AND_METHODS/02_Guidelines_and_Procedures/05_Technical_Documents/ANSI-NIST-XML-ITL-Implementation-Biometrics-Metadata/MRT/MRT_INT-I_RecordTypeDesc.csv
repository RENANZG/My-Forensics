"RecordType","RecordName","RecordDescription","Notes"
"1","Transaction Information Record","The Type-1 record shall provide information describing the type and use or purpose for the transaction involved, a listing of each record included in the transaction, the originator or source of the physical record, and other useful and required information items. Record Type-1 is mandatory. Transmissions to be exchanged are required to contain one and only one Type-1 record per transaction. The Type-1 record shall always be the first record within the transaction and at least one more record shall be present in the file. ",""
"2","User-defined Descriptive Text Record","Type-2 records are optional, but when present, shall contain user-defined textual fields providing identification and descriptive information associated with the subject of the transaction. This record may include such information as the state or FBI numbers, physical characteristics, demographic data, and the subject's criminal history. Every transaction usually contains one or more Type-2 records which is dependent upon the entry in Field 1.004 Type of transaction / TOT.",""
"4","Grayscale Fingerprint Image Record","Type-4 records were designed to convey fingerprint images captured by an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) live-scan reader, or other image capture devices operating at a nominal scanning resolution of 500 pixels per inch (ppi). Many systems still use this record type and it will remain an integral part of the ANSI-NIST standard. Many implementation domains and application profiles specify that unless fingers are missing or non-recordable, there shall be 14 Type-4 records in a file: ten rolled impressions of the individual fingers, two plain impressions of each thumb, and two simultaneously obtained plain impressions of the four remaining fingers on each hand. New users are encouraged to utilize record Type-14 to convey fingerprint images. Type-14 records may handle both 500 ppi images and those at greater resolutions that are now commonly exchanged.",""
"7","User-defined Image Record","Type-7 records shall contain user-defined image information relating to the transaction submitted for processing. Images transmitted using Record Type-7 shall consist of scanned pixels that may be either binary or grayscale output. This record was intended as a temporary measure to enable the exchange of image data that would be defined by specific record types in later versions of the standard. Since some older systems still use this record type, it is included in the standard. New implementations based on this standard are encouraged to use the Record Type-13: Friction-ridge Latent Image Record for latent records, and other record types, as appropriate, for transmitting biometric and forensic images. ",""
"8","Signature Image Record","Type-8 records shall be used for scanned binary or vectored signature image data. Each Type-8 record shall contain data representing the signature of the subject from whom the biometric sample is being collected and/or the operator capturing biometric data. Two signature image records (from the operator and the subject) are allowed per transaction. See Section 7.7.6 for resolution information. ",""
"9","Minutiae Data Record","Type-9 records shall contain text describing minutiae and related information encoded from a finger, palm, or plantar image. The Type-9 record shall also be used to exchange minutiae and related information from latent friction ridge images between similar or different systems. Each record shall represent the processed (automated and/or manual) image data from which the characteristics are stated. The primary use of this record type shall be for remote searching of latent prints. There is no limit on the number of Type-9 records for a latent search transaction.

Note: Reserved blocks, each consisting of several fields, are registered and allocated for use by specific vendors. As these blocks may contain proprietary information, no detailed information is provided regarding the content of these vendor-defined feature sets aside from the range of field numbers in this standard. For detailed information on each of these fields, the vendor should be contacted.",""
"10","Facial, Other Body Part & SMT Image Record","Type-10 image records shall contain and be used to exchange image data from the face, scars, (needle) marks, and tattoos (SMT).  ANSI-NIST 2011 extended the Type-10 to handle images of other body parts and a submission may now include several Type-10 images of a particular part of the body (see Field 10.039: Type-10 reference number / T10).  Type-10 can be used to exchange both grayscale and color image data in a compressed or uncompressed form.  Textual and analytic information pertinent to the digitized image is also contained in this record type.",""
"13","Friction-Ridge Latent Image Record","Type-13 image records shall contain and be used to exchange variable-resolution latent friction ridge image data (fingerprint, palmprint and/or plantar) together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitized image. These images may be used by agencies that will automatically extract or provide human intervention and processing to extract the desired feature information from the images.  In all cases, the scanning resolution for latent images shall be at least 39.37 ppmm (1000 ppi). The number of latent records in a transaction is only constrained by the total number of records that may be contained in a transaction.",""
"14","Fingerprint Image Record","The Type-14 record shall contain and be used to exchange exemplar fingerprint image data, such as a rolled tenprint, an identification flat, or a complete friction ridge exemplar.  Fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitized image may also be included. While the Type-14 record may be used for the exchange of 19.69 ppmm (500 ppi) images (all images shall be no less than 500 ppi), it is strongly recommended that the resolution for fingerprint images be 39.37 ppmm (1000 ppi). All fingerprint impressions shall be acquired from a card, a single or multiple-finger flat-capture device, contactless fingerprint sensor that outputs 2D fingerprint images, or a live-scan device.",""
"15","Palm Print Image Record","Type-15 image records shall contain and be used to exchange palm print image data together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitized image. The image data shall be acquired directly from a subject using a live-scan device, a palmprint card, or other media that contains the subject's palm and/or wrist prints. While the Type-15 record may be used for the exchange of 19.69 ppmm (500 ppi) images (all images shall be no less than 500 ppi), it is strongly recommended that the class resolution for Type-15 images be 39.37 ppmm (1000 ppi). A single Type-15 record will be required for each writer's palm and one to three Type-15 records for each full palm. Four to eight Type-15 records may be required to represent the subject's palmprints in a transaction. ",""
"16","User-defined Testing Image Record","The Type-16 record shall contain and be used to exchange image data together with textual information fields pertinent to the digitized image. This record type allows the exchange images not addressed by other record types in the standard. It is intended as the user-defined record to be used for developmental or test purposes. With the exception of the fields described in , the format, parameters, and types of images to be exchanged are undefined by this standard and shall be agreed upon between the sender and recipient.",""
"17","Iris Image Record","Type-17 image records shall contain iris image data. This record type was developed to provide a basic level of interoperability and harmonization with the ANSI INCITS 379-2004 Iris Image Interchange format and the ISO/IEC 19794-6 Iris Image Data Interchange Format. A user can exchange generic iris image data using mandatory fields of this record type. Optional fields may be used to exchange additional information available in the INCITS 379-2004 - Iris Image Interchange Format standard and the ISO/IEC 19794-6 Iris Image Data Interchange Format standard. ",""
"18","DNA Record","The Type-18 record shall contain and be used to exchange DNA data. It was developed to provide a basic level of interoperability with the draft format of the ISO/IEC 19794-14 DNA data interchange format. This shall be used to exchange Autosomal Short Tandem Repeat (STR), X-Short Tandem Repeat (X-STR) Y-Short Tandem Repeat (Y-STR), Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Pedigree, and electropherogram images of DNA data. With full consideration to privacy, this standard only uses the non-coding regions of DNA. The regions of the DNA that contain information on a subject's genetic characteristics or traits are deliberately avoided. ",""
"19","Plantar Image Record","Type-19 image records shall contain and be used to exchange variable-resolution plantar print image data together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitized image. Information regarding the scanning resolution used, the image size, and other parameters or comments required to process the image are recorded as fields within the record. While the Type-19 record may be used for the exchange of 19.69 ppmm (500 ppi) images, it is strongly recommended that the class resolution for plantar images be 39.37 ppmm (1000 ppi). Plantar print images transmitted to other agencies will be processed by the recipient agencies to extract the desired feature information required for matching purposes. ",""
"20","Source Representation Record","The Type-20 record contains the source representation(s) from which other Record Types were derived. Typically, one Type-20 source representation is used to generate one or more representations for use in other record types. 

There are many possible uses of a Type-20 record. One example is an image of multiple latent prints, of which one or more is of interest. Those would be segmented and prepared for sending in a Type-13 record. Another example is an audio/visual record which may provide both facial images for a Type-10 record. In some cases, several Type-20 records may be processed to derive a single Type-20 record. For example, a subject's face is segmented and stored in a Type-10 record from a group photo stored in a Type-20 record.",""
"21","Associated Context Record","The Type-21 record shall contain an associated context image, audio / visual recording or other related data. This record type does not contain information used to derive biometric information contained in other records. Record Type-20 serves that function. Record Type-21 may be used to convey contextual information, such as an image of the area where latent fingerprints were captured.",""
"98","Information Assurance Record","The Type-98 record shall contain security information that assures the authenticity and/or integrity of the transaction, possibly utilizing such techniques as binary data hashes, and/or digital signatures. There may be many instances of this Record Type per transaction. The records that are protected by a Type-98 are all records other than the Type-98 itself.",""
"99","CBEFF Biometric Data Record","Type-99 records shall contain and be used to exchange biometric data that is not supported by other ANSI/NIST-ITL record types. This provides a basic level of interoperability and harmonization with other biometric interchange formats. This is accomplished by using a basic record structure that is conformant with ANSI INCITS 398-2005, the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) and a biometric data block specification registered with the International Biometrics Industry Association (IBIA).

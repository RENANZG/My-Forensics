# Neolea training materials overview

![neolea logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neolea/neolea-training-materials/master/images/neolea-small.png)

The courses overview is centered around information sharing, collaboration around the different aspects of DFIR (digital forensic and incident response). The training setup includes a set of MISP instances in order to support the activities during the training and especially to improve collaboration between teams and sharing at large. The neolea training materials are part of the [neolea model](methodology.md) which is a concept in development to improve the capabilities for LEA while improving the tooling used in DFIR.

## Terminology

- 100 Introductory - Basis are required to benefit from the other trainings (MISP and information sharing)
- 200 Intermediate - DFIR topics (from digital forensic to network forensic analysis)
- 300 Advanced - Advanced topics (data mining, cryptography)

## Funding

The neolea project training materials is developed by [CIRCL Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg](https://www.circl.lu/), and co-financed within the [MISP-LEA project](https://www.misp-lea.org/).

MISP-LEA project started the first June 2023. It consists in an law enforcement agency information sharing community supported by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) and [Shadowserver](https://www.shadowserver.org/).

### Previous Funding

The neolea project training materials was developed by [CIRCL Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg](https://www.circl.lu/), and co-financed within ENFORCE.

[ENFORCE](https://ceis.eu/en/cyber-ceis-coordinator-of-the-enforce-project-co-organizes-a-cybercrime-training-with-the-luxembourgian-circl-and-the-french-national-police/) is an 18-month European project co-funded by the European Commission in the framework of the Internal Security Fund â€“ Police. The project runs from December 2018 to May 2020. The ENFORCE project aims at designing, setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This curriculum will be validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g. law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs) and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together using state-of-the-art training technology. ENFORCE project is coordinated by CEIS and a partnership between [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/), French Ministry of Interior and [CEIS](https://ceis.eu/).

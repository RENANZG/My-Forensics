# Of LEA interest
_A simple list of projects that are of interest to LEAs_

These are of interest to us because they are developing tools or contain information we recomend to consider. 
In some instances, we actively support and contribute to these projects.


## Artificial Intelligence
### Deepfakes
- [Cleverhans](http://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) - AI aided image processing can be fooled by specific paterns. Criminals might want to exploit this weaknes. Cleverhans helps assess what TensorFlow image classification systems are vulnerable to. Cleverhans pyhton scripts will help benchmark.

### Natural Language Processing & Large Language-and-Vision Assistants and Models (llamas, llavas)
- [Awesome NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp) - An inventory of Natural Language Processing resources.
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) - "Get up and running with large language models locally". A very simple-to-use solution, efficient and stand-alone. Includes the possibility to choose from llama or llava (Video) Manifests.
- [OpenGL Lab InternVL](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL) - A Pioneering Open-Source Alternative to GPT-4V the closest alternative to commercial solutions for image and video analysis.  
- [VFRAME](https://vframe.io/scene-summarization/) and its [Github](https://github.com/vframeio/vframe/) - Visual Forensics, Redaction, and Metadata Extraction. Uses AI to train models in explosive ordnance sportting. Could be used for other LEA related purposes, for instance under the Small Caliber Ammunition Reference Table (SCART) see: [Tech 4 Tracing](https://www.tech4tracing.  
- [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com) real-time object detection and image segmentation model. Check the directory of trained models at [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com). Includes pre-trained models for ammunitions, firearms, licence plates, etc...  
- [Whisper-mic](https://github.com/mallorbc/whisper_mic) - Will trasncript or interpret audio files or audio from the microphone. Works offline, tested on Mac OSX M3.

### Machine Learning
- [Cogment](https://docs.cogment.ai) - A high-efficiency framework designed to enable the training of models in environments where humans and agents interact with the environment and each other continuously. It’s capable of distributed, multi-agent, multi-model training.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) - OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). OpenCV is easy to integrate with Python scripting, it may be used to decode QRCodes containing cryptcurrencies public and private adresses.

### Datasets
- [Lemur Project](http://www.lemurproject.org) - A series of open source tools and huge datasets for research and development of information retrieval and text mining software
- [Open Government Datasets](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/resources/open-data-resources) Smart Nation Singapore - Open Government Datasets portal. This is a list of datasets offered by Singaporean public agencies.
- [Hugginface datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) - Open-access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing in PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy and Pandas.

## OSINT
- [OSINT Framework](https://github.com/lockfale/OSINT-Framework) - A list of resources for Open Source Inteligence.
- [OSINT Framework *LEA restricted version* ](https://github.com/INTERPOL-Innovation-Centre/OSINT-Framework) - Same as above but maintained by the INTERPOL innovation Centre, with an enhanced user interface and specific LEA resources. This repository is [For Official Use Only], contact us to be vetted.
- [Malfrat Industries' OSINT Map](https://map.malfrats.industries) - A lighter version of the OSINT Framework with currated resources.
- [Website Evidence Collector](https://github.com/EU-EDPS/website-evidence-collector) - (WEC) automates the collection, storage and transfer of personal data, preserving metadata and documenting it for offline use. The WEC is developped and maintained by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) as a tool to test compliance to GDPR.
- [A list of tools](https://git.io/secres) - Links to online resources & tools proposed by CompassSecurity.  
- [Vortimo](https://www.vortimo.com/) - Vortimo (by Roelof Temmingh, one of the original Maltego crew) is software that helps you with online investigations. Vortimo turns your boring browser into a super browser. It overlays pages with a heads-up display while it records, recalls, scrapes, enrich, reports and finds web pages you’ve visited before. And it does it all locally on your computer. It is very much like (Hunchly)[https://www.hunch.ly] on steroids.

## Dark web and virtual asssets investigation tools
### Virtual Assets Analytics
- [GraphSense](https://github.com/graphsense) - A Cryptocurrencies analytical tool is currently supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Litecoin and Zcash.
- [BlockChain Ecosystem](https://kumu.io/VincentD/the-blockchain-ecosystems-of-cryptocurrencies-exchangers-wallets-and-explorers#blockchains-ecosystems) - This is an interactive graph representing the main Crypocurrenices, their wallet client softwares, the exchanges concerned and other useful information.
### Dark web Analytics
- [OnionScan](https://github.com/s-rah/onionscan) - A repository of tools and technics to scan Onion servers for vulnerabilities and human errors (mis-configurations). Unfortunately this utility has not been updated for many months. There are many forks but none seems to be updated.
- [DOT, the Darkweb Onion Transform]() - was (it also ins't maintained) a tool to scan and scrape metadata from Onion hidden services.

## Malware analysis and threat intel
- [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) - A reverse engineering framework maintained by the US National Security Agency.
- [MISP](https://github.com/MISP) project - Open Source Threat Intelligence and Sharing Platform (formely known as Malware Information Sharing Platform).

## Digital Forensics
- [IPED](https://github.com/lfcnassif/IPED) - (Digital Evidence Processor and Indexer, original acronym is Brazilian), a set of scripts and tools to conduct Digital Forensics evidence exploitation. It is developed by Digital Forensics Experts of the Brazilian Federal Police

- [CASE](https://github.com/casework) - Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) is an Ontology for cyber investigations
- [Pantagrule](https://github.com/rarecoil/pantagrule) - Although not a tool, Pantagrule offers optimised rule sets for use with [HashCat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/). These rules offers faster results based on publicly available leaked passwords sets.

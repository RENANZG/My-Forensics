It is anticipated as being unique with the country.  Where submitted, it is intended that this would be shared back in any future interactions relating to the original biometric submission, allowing the submission party to more easily identify identify the context for initial response or future enquirers. It would allow the country to differentiate between biometric submission of the same person submitted on multiple occasions, over time. The source of the business reference is open for the individual country to decide; this could be an arrest event or warrant related reference. Whilst this could also be workflow event reference from the country's submission system, this reference is in addition to the mandated TCN and TCR elements.

It is made up of 2 subfields: a ISO3166 Alpha-3 country code identifying the country owning the Person, and the reference number itself.","","<int-i:NationalBusinessReference>

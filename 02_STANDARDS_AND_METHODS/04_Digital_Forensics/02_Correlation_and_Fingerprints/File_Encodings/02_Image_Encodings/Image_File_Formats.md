    <td>Settings and Capabilities</td>
    <td>Supports various compression schemes including LZW, ZIP, and uncompressed. Can store layers, transparency, and other metadata.</td>
    <td>Offers superior compression efficiency with options for both lossy and lossless compression. Supports progressive transmission and region of interest coding.</td>
    <td>Optimized for photographs and web images with adjustable quality settings. Does not support transparency.</td>
    <td>Uses lossless compression suitable for images with sharp edges, text, and areas of uniform color. Supports alpha channels for transparency.</td>
    <td>Offers significant file size reduction with high image quality. Supports HDR and wide color gamut.</td>
    <td>Designed for efficient compression and streaming. Supports both lossy and lossless compression.</td>
    <td>Primarily used for document storage and presentation, supporting embedded images with various compression schemes. Can include text, vector graphics, and multimedia elements.</td>

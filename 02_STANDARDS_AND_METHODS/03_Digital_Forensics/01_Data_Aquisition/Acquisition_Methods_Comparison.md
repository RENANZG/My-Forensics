    <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>
            Standard method. Involves copying data from a powered-off computer. 
            Ensures data integrity by preventing changes during acquisition.
        </td>
        <td>
            Involves copying data from a running system. 
            Preferred for systems with encrypted hard disks. 
            It captures volatile data, including RAM.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Advantages</td>
        <td>
            - Data is not altered during acquisition, ensuring integrity.<br>
            - Acquisition process can be repeated multiple times.
        </td>
        <td>
            - Essential for capturing volatile data (e.g., RAM, active network connections).<br>
            - Necessary for decrypting data on encrypted drives.<br>
            - Provides a comprehensive snapshot of the systemâ€™s current state.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Disadvantages</td>
        <td>
            - Cannot capture volatile data (e.g., RAM, running processes).<br>
            - Might not be suitable for encrypted drives without the decryption key.
        </td>
        <td>
            - Alters data on the system, potentially affecting integrity.<br>
            - Acquisition process cannot be exactly repeated.<br>
            - Requires careful handling to minimize data changes.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Usage Scenarios</td>
        <td>
            - Ideal for forensic analysis of hard drives and non-volatile storage.<br>
            - Used when system can be safely powered off without losing critical data.
        </td>
        <td>
            - Essential for investigations involving encrypted disks.<br>
            - Used to capture data that would be lost upon shutdown (e.g., RAM contents, live network connections).
        </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>
            Mostly used in Linux. The "dd" command is used to create Raw format files. 
            The drive is copied bit-by-bit, capturing an exact image of the storage device.
        </td>
        <td>
            Proprietary formats are developed by specific vendors and include features such as optional compression and segmentation of image files. Common examples include EnCase (.E01), FTK (.AD1), and SMART.
        </td>
        <td>
            An open-source format designed by Dr. Simson L. Garfinkel. AFF supports both compressed and uncompressed files and includes extensive metadata for documentation and verification purposes.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Advantages</td>
        <td>
            - Fast in transferring data<br>
            - Avoids minor errors during data read on source drive<br>
            - Compatible with most digital forensic tools<br>
            - Simple and widely understood format
        </td>
        <td>
            - Optional compression reduces storage space<br>
            - Segmenting files helps manage large data sets<br>
            - Integrity checks for each segment<br>
            - Metadata integration improves data context and traceability<br>
            - Often supported by professional forensic software
        </td>
        <td>
            - Supports both compressed and uncompressed files<br>
            - Open source, encouraging community-driven improvements<br>
            - Extensible design allows for future enhancements<br>
            - Rich metadata support<br>
            - Designed for forensic integrity and ease of verification
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Disadvantages</td>
        <td>
            - Requires large storage, equal to original disk size<br>
            - Bad sectors are not collected<br>
            - Low retry threshold on weak media spots<br>
            - Validation checking stored in isolated digest formats like MD5, SHA-1, CRC-32
        </td>
        <td>
            - Not easily sharable among different tools due to proprietary nature<br>
            - Segment size limitations (e.g., 650 MB or 2 GB)<br>
            - Potential cost of proprietary tools<br>
            - Dependency on vendor support and updates
        </td>
        <td>
            - Initial adoption may require training<br>
            - Compatibility with existing proprietary tools may vary<br>
            - Less widespread adoption compared to proprietary formats
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>File Extensions</td>
        <td>.raw</td>
        <td>Varies by tool (e.g., .E01 for EnCase, .AD1 for FTK, .SMART for SMART)</td>
        <td>.afd (segmented image files), .afm (metadata)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Usage Examples</td>
        <td>Used in Linux-based forensic investigations using tools like dd, dc3dd, and Guymager.</td>
        <td>Common in professional forensic software such as EnCase, FTK, and X-Ways Forensics.</td>
        <td>Utilized by forensic analysts seeking an open and extensible format; supported by tools like AFFLIB.</td>
